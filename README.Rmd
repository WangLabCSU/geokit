The goal of `rgeo` is to reduce the dependencies of [`GEOquery`](https://github.com/seandavi/GEOquery) and provide a unified R interface for most operation including both searching and downloading in [GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rgeo from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("Yunuuuu/rgeo")
```

## Features

- Low dependency, using [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) to implement all reading and preprocessing process. Reducing dependencies is the main purpose of this package since I have experienced several times of code failure after updating packages when using [`GEOquery`](https://github.com/seandavi/GEOquery).
- Provide a searching interface of [GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), in this way, we can filter the searching results using `R function`.
- Provide some useful utils function to deal with GEO datasets like `parse_pdata`, `set_pdata`, `log_trans` and `show_geo`.

## Vignettes

``` r
library(rgeo)
```

### Search GEO database - `search_geo`
The NCBI uses a search term syntax which can be associated with a specific search field with square brackets. So, for instance "Homo sapiens[ORGN]" denotes a search for `Homo sapiens` in the “Organism” field. Details see <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/qqtutorial.html>. We can use the same term to query our desirable results in `search_geo`. `search_geo` will parse the searching results and return a data.frame containing all the records based on the search term. The internal of `search_geo` is based on [`rentrez`](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez) package, which provides functions that work with the [NCBI Eutils](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/)
API, so we can utilize `NCBI API key` to increase the downloading speed, details see <https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/articles/rentrez_tutorial.html#rate-limiting-and-api-keys>.

Providing we want ***GSE*** GEO records related to ***human diabetes***, we can get these records by this:
``` r
diabetes_gse_records <- search_geo(
    "diabetes[ALL] AND Homo sapiens[ORGN] AND GSE[ETYP]"
)
diabetes_gse_records
```

### download data from GEO database - `get_geo`
