\title{Get Supplemental Files from GEO}
\usage{
geo_suppl(
  ids,
  pattern = NULL,
  ftp_over_https = TRUE,
  handle_opts = list(connecttimeout = 60L),
  odir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A character vector representing the GEO entity for downloading and
parsing. All ids must in the same GEO identity (\code{c("GDS505", "GDS606")} are
all GEO DataSets, \code{c("GSE2", "GSE22")} are all GEO series eg.).}

\item{pattern}{character string containing a \link[base:regex]{regular expression} to be matched in the supplementary file names.}

\item{ftp_over_https}{A scalar logical value indicates whether to connect GEO
FTP site with https traffic. If \code{TRUE}, will download FTP files from
\url{https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo}, which is used by GEOquery, otherwise,
will use \url{ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo} directly.}

\item{handle_opts}{A list of named options / headers to be set in the
\link[curl:handle]{handle}.}

\item{odir}{The destination directory for any downloads. Defaults to
current working dir.}
}
\value{
A list (or a character atomic verctor if only one \code{id} is provided)
of the full file paths of the resulting downloaded files.
}
\description{
NCBI GEO allows supplemental files to be attached to GEO Series (GSE), GEO
platforms (GPL), and GEO samples (GSM). This function 'knows' how to get
these files based on the GEO accession. No parsing of the downloaded files is
attempted, since the file format is not generally knowable by the computer.

\examples{
geo_suppl("GSM1137", odir = tempdir())
