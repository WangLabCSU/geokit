\usage{
get_geo_suppl(ids, dest_dir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A character vector representing the GEO identity for downloading
and parsing.  (eg., 'GDS505','GSE2','GSM2','GPL96')}

\item{dest_dir}{The destination directory for any downloads.  Defaults to
current working dir.}

\description{
NCBI GEO allows supplemental files to be attached to GEO Series (GSE), GEO
platforms (GPL), and GEO samples (GSM).  This function 'knows' how to get
these files based on the GEO accession.  No parsing of the downloaded files
is attempted, since the file format is not generally knowable by the
computer.
}
\note{
just a note that the files are simply downloaded.
}
\examples{

a <- get_geo_suppl("GSM1137", tempdir())
